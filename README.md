# Sample Node.js API

Welcome to this sample Node.js API project! This project is a starting point for newcomers looking to contribute to open source. We highly value contributions and follow best practices to make the process smooth.

## How It Works

- **Fork and Pull Request:** Instead of committing directly to the `main` branch, please fork the repository, create your changes, and submit a pull request.
- **Forks:** A fork is your own copy of this repository. Forking is the recommended approach for contributing because it keeps the original project safe from unreviewed changes.
- **CI/CD:** Our GitHub Actions workflow checks your code for linting and tests before merging.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Running the Project
To start the API server, use:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
5. Running Tests
This project uses Mocha and Supertest for testing the API endpoints. You can run the tests with:
    ```sh
    npm test
    ```
