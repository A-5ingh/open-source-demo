# Sample Node.js API

Welcome to this sample Node.js API project! This project is a starting point for newcomers looking to contribute to open source. We highly value contributions and follow best practices to make the process smooth.

## How It Works

- **Fork and Pull Request:** Instead of committing directly to the `main` branch, please fork the repository, create your changes, and submit a pull request.
- **Forks:** A fork is your own copy of this repository. Forking is the recommended approach for contributing because it keeps the original project safe from unreviewed changes.
- **CI/CD:** Our GitHub Actions workflow checks your code for linting and tests before merging.
