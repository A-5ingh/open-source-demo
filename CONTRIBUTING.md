# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! To ensure a smooth pull request process, please follow these guidelines:

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository:** Click the fork button on GitHub to create your own copy. Clone your fork locally.
2. **Create a Feature or Bugfix Branch:** Do not push directly to `main`. Create your branch (e.g., `feature/my-new-feature` or `bugfix/fix-issue-123`).
3. **Follow the Code Style:** Ensure your code matches our style guidelines.
4. **Write Tests:** Add tests for your changes where applicable.
5. **Submit a Pull Request:** Once your changes are ready, open a pull request. Your PR will be reviewed and merged once CI checks pass.
